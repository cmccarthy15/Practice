# Flight Practice
This is my repo of all of the problems I'm using to help prep for interviews. They're... mostly organized by where I found them.
Some are in JS and Python, some just one or the other.
I might also start dabbling in Java. We shall see

Good luck to all my fellow job hunters out there!
